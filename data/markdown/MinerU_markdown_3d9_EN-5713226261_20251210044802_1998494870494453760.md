![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/b3dfc8c4-d784-4861-b4d4-41d84b7d330c/669865ce156ca19a3524ecda5ce92892cd5ea2e5c24bcde40414033b4ee4e721.jpg)

# i Please note:

The first time you use the appliance, you will need to make a number of coffees to identify the correct dial position through trial and error.  
- Do not turn the dial too far towards MAX, otherwise the coffee may be delivered too slowly (a drop at a time), particularly when making two cups of coffee at the same time.

# Selecting the quantity of coffee in the cup

The appliance is set by default to automatically make the following quantities of coffee:

<table><tr><td>coffee requested</td><td>icon</td><td>quantity delivered</td></tr><tr><td>1 short coffee</td><td></td><td>(≈40ml)</td></tr><tr><td>1 long coffee</td><td></td><td>(≈120ml)</td></tr><tr><td>2 short coffees</td><td></td><td>(≈40ml) x2</td></tr><tr><td>2 long coffees</td><td></td><td>(≈120ml) x2</td></tr></table>

To change the quantity of coffee the appliance delivers automatically into the cup, proceed as described below:

- press and hold the icon (B2) or icon (B6) (depending on the quantity you want to modify) until the icon flashes and all the alarm lights flash 4 times. When the appliance starts delivering coffee, release the icon;  
- when the coffee in the cup reaches the required level, press the same icon again to memorise the new amount.

When the icon is pressed again, the new quantities have been memorised.

# i Please note!

Programming the one coffee quantity also programmes the quantity of coffee in the corresponding two cups.

# Adjusting the coffee mill

The coffee mill is set by default to prepare coffee correctly and should not require regulating initially.

However, if after making the first few coffees you find that the coffee is either too weak and not creamy enough or delivery is too slow (a drop at a time), this can be corrected by adjusting the grinding adjustment dial (fig. 8).

# i Please note!

The grinding adjustment dial must only be turned when the coffee mill is in operation.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/b3dfc8c4-d784-4861-b4d4-41d84b7d330c/f9372d1dbe8273b5fbe4906fbeac0bbd8da35944f8129020b2c61d7db7c3957e.jpg)

If the coffee is delivered too slowly or not at all, turn one click clockwise towards "7".

For fuller bodied creamier coffee, turn one click anticlockwise towards "1" (do not turn more than one click at a time otherwise the coffee could be delivered

a drop at a time). These adjustments will only be evident after at least 2 cups of coffee have been delivered. If this adjustment does not obtain the desired result, turn the dial another click.

# Tips for a hotter coffee

For hotter coffee, you should:

perform a rinse cycle before delivering the coffee by pressing the icon (B10);  
warm the cups with hot water (using the hot water function);  
increase coffee temperature as described in the previous paragraph (page 10).

# Making coffee using coffee beans

# Important!

Do not use caramelised or candied coffee beans as they could stick to the coffee mill and make it unusable.

1. Fill the container with coffee beans (fig. 9).  
2. Place under the coffee spouts: -1 cup, if you want to make 1 coffee (fig. 10); -2 cups, if you want 2 coffees (fig. 11).  
3. Lower the spouts as near as possible to the cup. This makes a creamier coffee (fig. 12).  
4. Press the icon corresponding to the required coffee:

<table><tr><td>coffee requested</td><td>icon</td></tr><tr><td>1 short coffee</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1 long coffee</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2 short coffees</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2 long coffees</td><td></td></tr></table>

5. Preparation begins and the light corresponding to the selected icon flashes on the touch screen.

Once the coffee has been made, the appliance is ready to make the next drink.

# i Please note:

While the machine is making coffee, delivery can be interrupted at any moment by pressing any icon.  
At the end of delivery, to increase the quantity of coffee in the cup, just press one of the coffee icons (within 3 seconds).

# SETTING WATER HARDNESS

The light comes on after a period of time established according to water hardness.

The machine is set by default for a hardness value of 4. The machine can also be programmed according to the hardness of the mains water in the various regions so that the machine needs to be descaled less often.

# Measuring water hardness

1. Remove the "TOTAL HARDNESS TEST" indicator paper from its pack (attached to the English instructions).  
2. Immerse the paper completely in a glass of water for one second.  
3. Remove the paper from the water and shake lightly. After about a minute, 1, 2, 3, or 4 red squares form, depending on the hardness of the water. Each square corresponds to one level.

# ELECTRICAL CONNECTION (UK ONLY)

Before using this appliance ensure that the voltage indicated on the product corresponds with the main voltage in your home, if you are in any doubt about your supply contact your local electricity company.

The flexible mains lead is supplied connected to a B.S. 1363 fused plug having a fuse of 13 amp capacity.

Should this plug not fit the socket outlets in your home, it should be cut off and replaced with a suitable plug, following the procedure outlined below.

Note: Such a plug cannot be used for any other appliance and should therefore be properly disposed of and not left where children might find it and plug it into a supply socket - with the obvious consequent danger.

Please note: We recommend the use of good quality plugs and wall sockets that can be switched off when the machine is not in use.

IMPORTANT: The wires in the mains lead fitted to this appliance are coloured in accordance with the following code:

GREEN AND YELLOW  
BLUE  
BROWN

EARTH NEUTRAL LIVE

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/b3dfc8c4-d784-4861-b4d4-41d84b7d330c/dfe1ce6f3ae87230c60d9005958de970e53e18e3e2b7ecb4d14fd8cdbc50452d.jpg)

As the colours of the wires in the mains lead of this appliance may not correspond with the coloured markings identifying the terminals in your plug, proceed as follows:

- The wire which is coloured green and yellow must be connected to the terminal in the plug which is marked with the letter E or by the earth symbol  $\equiv$  or coloured green or green and yellow.  
- The wire which is coloured blue must be connected to the terminal which is marked with the letter N or coloured black.  
The wire which is coloured brown must be connected to the terminal which is marked with the letter L or coloured red.

When wiring the plug, ensure that all strands of wire are securely retained in each terminal. Do not forget to tighten the mains lead clamp on the plug. If your electricity supply point has only two pin socket outlets, or if you are in doubt, consult a qualified electrician.

Should the mains lead ever require replacement, it is essential that this operation be carried out by a qualified electrician and should only be replaced with a flexible cord of the same size.

After replacement of a fuse in the plug, the fuse cover must be refitted. If the fuse cover is lost, the plug must not be used until a replacement cover is obtained. The colour of the correct replacement fuse cover is that of the coloured insert in the base of the fuse recess or elsewhere on the plug. Always state this colour when ordering a replacement fuse cover.

Only 13amp replacement fuses which are asta approved to B.S. 1362 should be fitted.

This appliance conforms to the Norms EN 55014 regarding the suppression of radio interference.
